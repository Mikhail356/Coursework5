    Information Retrieval deals with searching and retrieving information within
    the documents and it also searches the online databases and internet. Web
    crawler is defined as a program or software which traverses the Web and
    downloads web documents in a methodical, automated manner. Based on the type
    of knowledge, web crawler is usually divided in three types of crawling
    techniques: General Purpose Crawling, Focused crawling and Distributed
    Crawling. In this paper, the applicability of Web Crawler in the field of
    web search and a review on Web Crawler to different problem domains in web
    search is discussed.

    In this paper we study how to build an eﬀective incremental crawler. The
    crawler selectively and incrementally updates its index and/or local
    collection of web pages, instead of periodically refreshing the collection
    in batch mode. The incremental crawler can improve the “freshness” of the
    collection signiﬁcantly and bring in new pages in a more timely manner. We
    ﬁrst present results from an experiment conducted on more than half million
    web pages over 4 months, to estimate how web pages evolve over time. Based
    on these experimental results, we compare various design choices for an
    incremental crawler and discuss their trade-oﬀs. We propose an architecture
    for the incremental crawler, which combines the best design choices.

    Due to the current size of the Web and its dynamic nature, building an
    efficient search mechanism is very important. A vast number of web pages are
    continually being added every day, and information is constantly changing.
    Search engines are used to extract valuable Information from the internet.
    Web crawlers are the principal part of search engine, is a computer program
    or software that browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated
    manner or in an orderly fashion. It is an essential method for collecting
    data on, and keeping in touch with the rapidly increasing Internet. This
    Paper briefly reviews the concepts of web crawler, its architecture and its
    various types.
